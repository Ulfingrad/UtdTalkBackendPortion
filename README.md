# What is this app?
The purpose of this app is to showcase simple routing and endpoints using Express.js! In the base branch (main) you will find a template of sorts in order to practice creating endpoints and create a working back-end!

# Starting the App
If you are simply looking to run the completed app, check out the section on the completed version [below](#Where-can-I-find-the-completed-version-and-how-do-I-set-it-up?)

To setup the app for practice, a few commands will need to be run to get started:

## Setting up the environment
1. First off, make sure you have a terminal to execute the next series of commands inside of. I recommend [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as it is a solid terminal, and can be used inside of VS Code.

2. Next, make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed before doing anything! You WILL NOT be able to run the next series of commands if you do not have Node.js installed.

3. Install Typescript globally by entering `npm install -g typescript` into the console

# Interacting with the app

# Where can I find the completed version and how do I set it up?
The completed version of this app is just in a separate branch!
